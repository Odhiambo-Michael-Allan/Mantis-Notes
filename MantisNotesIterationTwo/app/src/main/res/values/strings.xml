    <string name="sample_note">When you speak a language, you need to follow grammar rules
        and use commonly known vocabulary, otherwise nobody would under-
stand you. Similar idea applies to code. Each programming language has its
        syntax and if you violate that syntax, the compiler cannot
understand your code. Each language also comes with certain conventions
        (these do not matter to the compiler, but matter greatly to
humans reading the code). Following certain conventions when writing code
        makes it easier to read and to debug. For the benefit of
your code readers and your own, you should follow the coding conventions
        outlined in this document.</string>
